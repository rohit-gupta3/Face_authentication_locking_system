 Follow the Instructions accordingly to get no errors.
 
1. Download the latest Version of Proteus Simulation Software.
2. Download the latest version of Python IDE(Preferable VS-Code).
3. Download the face-recognition packages/Libraries after having below packages.
	-openCV Libraries.
	-dlib, cmake libraries.
	-tensorflow.
***********************************************************************************************************************
Note==========> This is the most important step and difficult one I would say.
		Please before moving forward you have to install these Libraries on the system.
		You can refer any video on youtube for installing face-recognition Libraries.
		I used Anaconda for installing face-recognition and creating the enviroment.
		You also can create it without anaconda. No mandatory at all.
		I will prefer to install the Libraries on your system itself so that you don't have to change your interpreter settings.
		I struggled here a bit so please do it properly. Sometimes if system is not responding properly then restart the device, 
		the setting will be updated after restart.

4. Make the Changes in the code according to your settings.
	-Emails and its app password.(refer youtube)
	-Image file names and update the image.
5. Download VSPE (Virtual Serial Port Simulator)
	-Use connector
	-Change the setting(if not working) Band rate should be 9600.

6. We also have to add the PIR sensor Library in the Proteus(if not present) Libraries so that our Simulation Part work fine.

7. Now run the Simulation and after that run the code.
   When the terminal showing "Waiting for Bell input" it means your simulation and code is working fine,
   now press the bell in the simulator camera will be opened and rest operation will happen.

Hence, This is the Simple Face Authentication Locking System IOT project with the simulation.
There are many ways to install this software and libraries. You can choose any one which is easier for you.
